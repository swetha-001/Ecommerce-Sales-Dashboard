# Ecommerce-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard (Power BI)

 ## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to analyze an E-commerce storeâ€™s sales performance and measure target achievements across categories, states and time periods. The challenge was to handle different granularity levels in the dataset (daily sales vs. monthly targets), build a reliable data model and create an interactive Power BI dashboard to derive actionable insights.

## Data Overview

The dataset consists of three tables:
1. List of Orders
     * Columns: Order ID, Order Date, Customer Name, State, City
2. Order Details
     * Columns: Order ID, Amount, Profit, Quantity, Category, Sub-Category
3. Sales Target
     * Columns: Month of Order Date, Category, Target

## Data Cleaning & Data Model Creation

- Established a 1-to-many relationship between List of Orders[Order ID] and Order Details[Order ID].
- Faced a many-to-many issue between Order Date (daily) and Sales Target (monthly).
- Solution Implemented using DAX :
    * Created a Calendar Table using DAX with one row per date.
    * Added a [Month Start] column in the Sales Target table for exact match with Calendar.
    * Built a Month Bridge Table with unique rows per month, enabling a proper one-to-many relationship.
    * Ensured all tables connect through this bridge for accurate time-based reporting.

- Category Analysis: Sales by Category, Profit by Category, Profit Margin by Category
- Time Analysis: Sales by Month, Sales vs Target by Month
- Customer Analysis: Top 10 Customers by Sales, Profit, and Purchase Frequency
- Geographical Analysis: Average Profit by State
- Interactivity:
    * Slicers for Date, Category, Region
    * Navigation bar with buttons for page switching

## Insights Generated

- `Clothing` emerged as the `most profitable` category with a profit margin of `8.03`, while `Furniture` underperformed with just `1.81`.
- `Punjab` ranked among the top five states in order volume but showed a negative average profit (-10 Loss), highlighting a region for immediate improvement.
- In July 2018, sales reached 12,966 against a target of 33,800, with the lowest Target Achievement % of `38.36%`, revealing major target-setting/achievement gaps.
- `Electronics` recorded the highest `sales volume`, though `Clothing` remained the most `profitable`.

# Business Impact

The dashboard can help the store identify underperforming regions and categories, uncovering a profitability gap of 6.22 points between Clothing and Furniture.
By tracking target achievement rates and highlighting loss-making states like Punjab, the store can reallocate resources and optimize strategies, potentially improving overall profitability by 10-15%.
